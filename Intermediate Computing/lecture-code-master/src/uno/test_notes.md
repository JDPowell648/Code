## Things We Should Test
* test that Player always picks a legal card
* notification when game ends
* cards are removed from hands/discard piles
* initial deck is randomized
* discard pile --> shuffled --> draw pile

## Test Dependencies
* Player: UnoCard(s), UnoGameState
* UnoGame: stubbed Player

## Mock Objects
These allow us a way to simulate an object and then check
how it has been used...
